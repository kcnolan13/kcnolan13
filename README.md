## 👋 Hey, I'm Kyle.

I'm a software engineer and the founder of [ProjectionLab](https://projectionlab.com).

I couldn't find a good financial and retirement planning app for FIRE and financial independence that felt modern, flexible, and engaging... so I [decided to build one!](https://projectionlab.com/blog/choosefi-podcast)

Right now I'm working on PL full-time. But 4 years ago, this seemed literally impossible.

If you asked what my odds were of ever making a living building indie software, I would have said: **1-5%** 😬

Back then:  
❌ $0 MRR  
❌ No marketing experience  
❌ Graveyard of side projects I never tried to monetize  
💡 An idea for a new one  

4 years later:  
🧑‍💻 150,000+ lines of original code  
👥 25,000+ MAUs  
🤑 $52,000+ / mo revenue  
👨‍💼 A growing team  
🥾 Fully bootstrapped!  

PL has changed my life. And it's a real honor to hear that it's already made a small impact in the lives of so many others.

But when I was first getting started, seeing famous indiehackers like @levelsio, @dannypostmaa, etc, was kind of intimidating.

Don't get me wrong. It was inspiring to see people take a leap of faith, chase their dreams, build a business, grow an audience, and make a living doing what they love.

But to me, that just felt soooo far out of reach.

Like... that wasn't something **I** could actually do... was it?

What about the risks? The uncertainty? Survivorship bias? The emotional rollercoaster?

There are always a million reasons to doubt yourself. To not take that bold step into the unknown.

But in life, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

And no matter the outcome, it's always more fun to chat with someone who gave it their all, than with someone who never dared to venture off the safest path.

Looking ahead, I'm excited to see what the next 4 years will bring.

I may not have fully executed the "growing an audience" part above, or posting regularly on social platforms. But you know what? Maybe that's fine.

I'm incredibly grateful that such a supportive community of users, partners, and friends has organically sprung up around ProjectionLab.

And I'm going to keep spending the lion's share of my time making the platform better and better, a little every day! 😊
